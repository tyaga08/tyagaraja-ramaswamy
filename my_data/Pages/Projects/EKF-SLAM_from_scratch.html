              <p>
                This project aims at implementing EKF based
                online SLAM for mobile robots in indoor environment. We use
                data from 2D Lidar and wheel encoder to estimate the state
                of the robot and use EKF based filtering techniques to build
                a map. We would use ROS and Gazebo for simulation of our
                implementation.

                  The methodology followed is mentioned below:
                  <br>
                  • Give the input to the robot
                  <br>
                  • Collect the sensor data (LIDAR/odometry).
                  <br>
                  • Perform sensor fusion on the data
                  <br>
                  • Extract Features from the LIDAR Data
                  <br>
                  • Add new features into the database
                  <br>
                  • For existing features, send the position information to
                  the kalman update step
                  <br>
                  • Calculate the kalman gain
                  <br>
                  • Calculate the new estimate based on previous estimate
                  and measured value
                  <br>
                  • Update the map with the new information
                  <br>
                  • Do the above steps till the loop closure is attained
                  <br>
                  • Repeat the steps to improve the accuracy of the map
                </p>

                  <strong>1. Landmark Extraction:</strong>
                  <br>
                  The simulator environment which we have created has
                  cylindrical pillars as landmarks which should be extracted
                  from the sensor data. Whenever there is a cylinder in the
                  environment, the rays hitting the cylinder will have a range
                  value different from the others. This changes can be found
                  out by taking the derivatives of the sensor data and finding
                  the spikes in the data.So,the derivatives of the sensor data are
                  calculated at each instant and stored in a list. The start of the
                  cylinder can be found by finding the negative spike whereas
                  the end of the cylinder can be found out by positive spike. We
                  should also consider the case of overlapping cylinders which
                  might give multiple spikes. These edge cases also addressed
                  in the algorithm given below. So, the Algorithm 1 explains
                  the extraction of the landmark position by finding spikes in
                  the environment

                  <strong>2. Extended Kalman Filter</strong>
                  <br>
                  The sensor data used for state estimation, being noisy,
                  gives rise to accumulated errors. There are several techniques
                  to reduce the error and one of the well established methods
                  is to use recursive probabilistic filters. The Bayes filter is
                  a recursive probabilistic filter which uses a prior belief and
                  applies Bayes theorem to get a posterior estimate.
                  <br>
                  <a href="../../../my_images/projects/EKF-SLAM_from_scratch/Bayes_thm.png"><img style="width:50%;max-width:50%" alt="Bayes Thm" src="../../../my_images/projects/EKF-SLAM_from_scratch/Bayes_thm.png" class="hoverZoomLink"></a>
                  <br>
                  Kalman Filter is a variant of the Bayes filter where,
                  the states are considered as a Gaussian distribution with a
                  mean around the actual value and an uncertainty defined by
                  the covariance. The problem with Kalman Filter is that it
                  cannot be applied to non-linear systems. In order to use this
                  methodology to non-linear systems, the system is linearized
                  using Taylor’s expansion or Jacobian Linearization. This
                  method is called Extended Kalman Filter.
                  <br>
                  The Extended Kalman Filter has two steps: (a) prediction
                  step and (b) correction step. In the prediction step, the current
                  state is predicted using the previous state and the current
                  input. This gives us a belief of our current state with some
                  uncertainty. This uncertainty is reduced after the correction
                  step. In this step, sensor measurement data is used to correct
                  our predicted belief. The prediction step is also called Motion
                  Model and the correction step is also called Observation
                  Model.
