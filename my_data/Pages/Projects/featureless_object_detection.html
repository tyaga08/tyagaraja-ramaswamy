                In this project I tried using classical geometry based computer vision for detecting 2-d colored brontosaurus. Figure 1
                depicts the target object that has dimensions of 8.4X6.1. Due to its highly 2-dimensional shape, the thickness can be 
                omitted from our models (4mm).

                        Triangulation is a method that is generally used for pathfinding algorithms. If there is a set of points in a plane 
                        and the path has to be found to traverse from one point to the other, triangulating these points helps find the 
                        required path. One of the triangulation methods, Delaunay triangulation, can be used for object detection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Delaunay Triangulation: The triangulation, f(t), of a set of discrete points P in a plane, is said to be Delaunay 
                        Triangulation iff no point in P is inside or on the circumcircle of any triangle of f(t), except the triangle 
                        vertices themselves. If this condition is fulfilled, then the triangulation is always unique for the set of points [1].
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For instance, if there are 4 points as shown below, there are two possible ways of forming triangles as shown in 
                        Fig 3(b) and 3(c). However, if the circumcircles are drawn for both cases, it can be seen that the latter does 
                        not satisfy the Delaunay Triangulation criterion.

                        This triangulation method gives a unique form to the object, which could be used to find few intrinsic image properties 
                        of the object, otherwise featureless in this case. So the basic algorithm used in this technique to detect the object is
                        as follows.
                        <br>a. Color segmentation
                        <br>b. Finding contours
                        <br>c. Delaunay Triangulation
                        <br>d. Condition for object detection
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Intuitively it can be seen that, this method is dependent on the geometry of the object. Since the image is practically
                        featureless, the object geometry is the most important information that can be used for its detection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Color Segmentation:</strong>
                        <br>
                            The brontosaurus (object to be detected) has uniform color throughout its area, which can be used for finding 
                            the contours in the image. The image is segmented using the HSV color thresholding. HSV stands for Hue, 
                            Saturation and Value. The Hue determines the actual color of the pixel, Saturation gives the amount of gray 
                            value in it and the Value gives the amount of luminance/brightness. The advantage of HSV color thresholding 
                            is that the effect of luminance/brightness can be controlled by keeping the maximum range of V. The thresholded 
                            image is then given to the contour finding function.
                    </p>

                        <strong>Finding Contours:</strong>
                        <br>
                        This function takes a thresholded image and returns any closed contour that is present in the thresholded image. 
                        We have added a small area threshold for considering the contour, meaning that the contour for which the area is 
                        below this threshold would be chopped off from the list. The function returns an array of points for each contour. 
                        For each contour we calculate the centroids given by,

                        The set of sampled points of the contours along with the contour centroid are sent as an argument to the function 
                        finding the Delaunay triangles. According to the criterion mentioned above, the triangle coordinates are computed 
                        and stored in an array. Two algorithms for computing the Delaunay triangles have been discussed in [2]. Once the 
                        triangles are formed, we compute the centroids of each triangle as shown in Fig. 4(b).

                        <br>
                        Now we have the triangles and the centroids. This is a
                        unique representation of the object and it defines the geometric
                        properties of the object. One of the properties that we have used
                        for our object detection is the distribution of fixed points in the
                        object. For implementing this algorithm, the first thing that is
                        done is defining a base axis of the object which would define
                        the orientation of the object. In order to achieve this the
                        following algorithm was implemented.

                        <option>
                            i. Choose a model image with only the object and find
                            the centroid of the object.
                        </option> 
                        <option>
                            ii. Find the point on the contour with the maximum
                            distance from the centroid and find its angle (counterclockwise) 
                            with respect to the horizontal.
                        </option>
                        
                        <option>
                            iii. Now in the test image for all the contours find the point
                            with maximum distance from the contour centroid.
                            Rotate the line clockwise with the angle found in step ii.
                        </option>
                            iv. This forms the base x axis and the axis perpendicular
                            to it forms the base y axis. This is shown in Fig. 4(b)
                            Once the base axis is set, the next step is to find the mean
                            normalised distance from the triangle centroid to the base axes.
                        <br>

                        normalised distance from the triangle centroid to the base axes.

                        The above step is done for the model object and the range
                        of the mean distances are set. The mean is divided by a
                        normalizing factor in order to make it scale invariant. In our
                        case we used the maximum distance from the centroid as the
                        normalizing factor. This computed mean is used for comparison
                        with the test image and the object detection is done.
                    <p>
                        It was observed that the value of the mean normalized
                        distance ranged from 0.4 to 0.8. It can be seen from the Fig. 5
                        that this method is robust to perspective transformation but not
                        robust to occlusion. Higher the range of the mean normalized
                        distance, higher is the is the probability of the object getting
                        matched. However this increases the chance of false positives
                        getting detected, as seen in the Fig. 5(e)(f) where a kangaroo
                        with similar shape is being detected as the brontosaur
